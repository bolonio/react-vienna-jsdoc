# Automating JSDoc documentation generation with Github actions

This is a repo that illustrates my talk "Automating JSDoc documentation generation with Github actions" at the React Vienna meetup.

This repo contains some common hooks and utils that are used in React projects. The goal is to show how to automate the generation of JSDoc documentation using Github actions.

You can see the slides in https://speakerdeck.com/bolonio/automating-jsdoc-documentation-generation-with-github-actions
